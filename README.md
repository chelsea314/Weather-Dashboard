##  How it Works:
When the user first arrives to the Weather Dashboard, they will be presented with a form to search for a city. 
![Search City](./assets/images/search-city.png)

Users will be able to view the current day's weather as well as the five day forecast for the city in which they searched. 
![View Weather](./assets/images/view-weather.png)

The color surrounding the UV Index for the current day's weather will change color based on the severity. 

Green indicates a low risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure, yellow indicates a moderate risk and red indicates a high risk.
